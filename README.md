# TCGInventory

This project provides simple utilities to manage Magic: The Gathering cards via SQLite.

## Usage

Run the CLI via the module path so Python can resolve the `TCGInventory` package:

```bash
python -m TCGInventory.cli
```

Example functions can also be called programmatically, e.g.:

```python
from TCGInventory.lager_manager import add_card
```
